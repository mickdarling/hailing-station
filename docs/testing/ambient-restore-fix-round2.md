# Ambient restore, fix round 2 (#904 ask 3)

Synthetic offline evidence for the restore-core and restore-app slices. This is
not a physical microphone round trip, an iOS application build, or physical haptic
proof. No installed build, TestFlight identifier, PR, issue, or remote ref changed.
Independent exact-head review of these fixes remains pending.

## Fail-before evidence

The eight review probes were ported into `AmbientReconnectReview*Tests` and run
against unchanged core head `4085ccdf6cc1213ce4ca6da39c82dc7675055293`.
The run exited 1: **8 tests, 6 failing, 10 failed assertions**. The six failing
methods were:

- `senderAlreadyInFlightMustNotRebindPreDropPCMToReplacementConnection`
- `delayedOldGenerationModeEventMustNotConfirmNewGenerationPrivacy`
- `failedOwnerPrivacyTapMustNotBeClearedByAnotherHostsConfirmation`
- `secondDropBeforeFirstResumedPCMStillMustDiscardAtCapture`
- `retainedSuccessCardMustNotKeepStreamingAfterTargetRemoval`
- `asynchronousWireRefusalMustNotAnnounceSuccessfulRestore`

The two second-drop probes during privacy confirmation and reauthorization
passed before the fix. Their notice expectations now require the newly specified
per-drop outcomes rather than the old coalesced success. The sender test feeds
fresh PCM after releasing its held old sender so a correct implementation can
progress after discarding the old send. The target-removal test does not wait for
forbidden PCM to appear. The origin test now injects the actual old generation
through the new dispatcher context and verifies a genuine new-generation
confirmation can subsequently restore. Test helpers only factor the long probes;
the failing security assertions remain in committed tests.

The host-local baseline log is `fix2-fail-before.log` in the authorized scratch
directory; it is not a committed build product. Its command used the common
flags below and `test --disable-xctest --no-parallel --filter AmbientReconnectReview
--skip DiagnosticReplyComposition`.

## Root causes and fixes

1. A controller send closure rewrote its binding to the latest one, including
   for a suspended, in-flight old encoder. Every queue send now carries its
   immutable capture epoch through executor hops. Each encoder's stream binds
   once, a new binding requires a resume start, and the connection actor checks
   the binding's generation before any send. Mismatches throw and discard; they
   never fall back to a newer binding. Late old-send errors cannot poison the
   replacement stream. The first restored frame is sequence zero with resume.
2. Privacy confirmation substituted the store's latest snapshot for callback
   provenance. The connection dispatcher now stamps the receiving generation
   before the callback's actor hop. Confirmation requires that exact generation;
   stale mode callbacks cannot change privacy state or settle a switch request.
3. Host confirmation used to clear a latched owner veto globally. Only
   `ownerStarted` now clears a veto. A healthy owner's unsettled switch request
   stays in that host's own request state; a drop with it pending, a gap tap, a
   failed send, or a mismatching confirmation latches the veto. Another host's
   notices cannot clear or reinterpret it. The regression also proves a fresh
   owner start clears the veto and permits a later restore.
4. Pending recovery skipped suspension on later drops. Every distinct dropped
   socket closes admission immediately, including after renewal but before PCM.
   Send failure and receive-loop reports for the same socket coalesce as one
   drop. A different dropped generation ends the interrupted attempt once as
   failed, starts a fresh attempt, and keeps the original 60-second deadline.
   The second-drop probes and
   `secondDropHasItsOwnOutcomeButCannotExtendOriginalCaptureDeadline` cover this
   definition of flapping, capture discard, background reuse, and terminal notice
   counts. No cancellation callback can revive an older attempt.
5. A completed notice retained the destination card, while an authoritative empty
   target list still yielded its old binding. The core invalidates that binding.
   The app slice renders the current notice at the root independently of the
   card, retains the card only for pending transport recovery, and keeps normal
   destination-loss and binding-change hooks active. It avoids putting obsolete
   reconnect successes in the unrelated announcement queue.
6. Ambient streams have **no positive host acceptance acknowledgement**. The
   existing pong acknowledges target selection, not acceptance of the stream.
   Therefore a terminal ambient refusal is published immediately on receipt,
   carrying both the connection generation and refused stream ID. The owning
   controller stops capture and revises any applied notice to failed/moved-away
   with the same notice ID. A refusal preceding send completion also prevents
   that completion from publishing applied. The separate
   `refusalAfterAppliedReplacesNoticeWithoutWaitingForMorePCM` test verifies the
   correction requires no subsequent PCM. Transient-refusal recovery is retained.

The reapplication starts with R0 (two infrastructure files) on main-24be, followed
by R1 (four restore files) and R2 (two app files). `AmbientListeningReconnect`
remains in its own file with its privacy-confirmation helper. A reasoned
file-length exemption keeps those related types together. The #932 segment
wiring, reply_yield and capability advertisement remain intact.

The original fail-before run above is retained; it was against the old R1 base,
not re-recorded against main-24be. The reapplication ports those same assertions
and reruns pass-after on the new base. Independent exact-head review is pending.

## Verification commands

Every Swift phase runs under `taskpolicy -b`, with `-j 4 -Xswiftc -j1`, automatic
resolution disabled, and scratch products only in the authorized scratch tree.
A process-group cleanup trap terminates descendants on interruption or a 590 s
phase timeout. Phases run sequentially, using at most four workers. Common test
support flags are:

```text
-Xswiftc -F/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Library/Developer/Frameworks
-Xswiftc -plugin-path
-Xswiftc /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/lib/swift/host/plugins/testing
-Xlinker -rpath -Xlinker /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Library/Developer/Frameworks
-Xlinker -rpath -Xlinker /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Library/Developer/usr/lib
```

Per branch: `swift build -Xswiftc -warnings-as-errors`; `swift build --build-tests`;
five `swift test --skip-build --disable-xctest --no-parallel --filter AmbientReconnect
--skip DiagnosticReplyComposition` runs. The serial broad family is
`Ambient|HostConnection|Listening|Reconnect|Notice|AudioGate|TapCapture|HeardTurn|Privacy|ReplySegment`.
It is partitioned into two bounded, non-overlapping lanes: HailCoreTests only,
then the same family excluding HailCoreTests. Both skip DiagnosticReplyComposition.
The five focused repetitions also execute the host pre-arm/start-private
`AmbientReconnectHostAdmissionTests` more than the required three times.

`restorePathNeverSendsPrivacyOffAcrossRepeatedDrops` covers both known-public and
known-private restores through two drops, and inspects every control send. The
privacy-host assertions separately require exactly one privacy-on per private
attempt. Restore never sends `set_privacy off`.

Manual strict lint review covers 200-line files unless already disabled or covered
by the coordinator's explicit exemption for the reconnect file,
150-line type bodies, 40-line function bodies, complexity 10, 120-column code,
parameter counts, nesting, optional Bool, and tuple sizes. The lightweight
brace-count aid misidentifies protocol requirements as function bodies; those
unchanged requirements were inspected manually. Whitespace-only closing-brace
cleanup in the ported tests preserves the exact non-whitespace token sequence.
`git diff --check` is also required.

## Reapplication boundaries

R0 supplies origin task-locals, opt-in refusal notices, and the optional immutable
send-admission predicate. R1 samples the capture epoch when creating each queue;
that predicate checks the same gate after every executor hop. R1 explicitly opts
in to refusal notices around both `connect` and foreground nudges so every
replacement receive-loop task inherits the flag. R1 alone remains inert for
transport restoration until an app attaches its controller.

The incremental production-file counts are R0 **2**, R1 **4**, R2 **2**.
The cumulative counts against main-24be are **2**, **5**, **7**, respectively;
the review bases must be main-24be, R0, and R1. No renamed file is involved.
R1's four files are Capture.swift, AmbientAudioStreamer.swift,
AmbientListeningReconnect.swift, and Transport/HostConnectionStore.swift.
The #932 store suffix and both ingress hooks were compared with main-24be;
they remain byte-for-byte intact. The R0 protocol patch keeps reply_yield and
ReplySegments capability advertisement.

The new-base commands use warnings-as-errors on the test build too. The first
clean CLT link emits debug-module-path warnings for scratch PCM references;
no Swift source warning is suppressed. iOS app builds and physical haptic/audio
proof remain unverified on this Command Line Tools-only VM.

### R1 results on main-24be plus R0

Both required builds passed. All **54 focused tests in 18 suites** passed on each
of five runs. The serial broad lanes passed **377 tests in 99 suites** (236.673 s)
and **637 tests in 141 suites** (423.036 s), including the #932 device, host, and
protocol segment suites. No DiagnosticReplyComposition suite ran. All six failed
review probes now pass, along with the extra late-refusal and flapping deadline
checks and every earlier privacy/no-off test. Manual strict-warning lint review
and `git diff --check` passed; the brace-count aid's two Capture protocol findings
are declaration false positives, not function bodies. The reconnect file uses
only the expressly permitted, reasoned file-length exemption.

### R2 results and final-tree checks

R2 changes only StationCard.swift and RootView+DestinationSelection.swift in
production. The completed notice lives on the root surface, independently of
the card. The card is retained only during pending recovery; disappearance still
calls destinationLost. The destination-selection helpers are grouped in two
extensions within the same 199-line file, without another exemption or file.
The notifier deduplicates the haptic by notice ID when a late refusal corrects a
success. Existing per-stop notification titles remain unchanged.

Both required SwiftPM builds passed. All **55 focused tests in 19 suites** passed
on each of five runs. The serial broad lanes passed **378 tests in 100 suites**
(240.990 s) and **637 tests in 141 suites** (417.080 s). The #932 segment suites
remain green. DiagnosticReplyComposition was excluded throughout.
`successNoticeNeverRetainsCaptureOrAuthorizesADestination` models target removal,
destination change, and card disappearance; all three cases release capture,
clear the active binding, and forbid later PCM while retaining notice history.
This model is not native SwiftUI or physical-device proof.

A final blank-closing-brace cleanup in R1 test support preserves every Swift
token. Both required builds were rechecked on the final R1 and R2 source trees.
The extra final R1 review selection passed **9 tests in 6 suites**; the extra
R2 lifetime selection passed **1 test with 3 cases**. Strict-warning manual lint,
committed-range `git diff --check`, exact production-file counts (including rename
handling), and the three-commit stack audit passed. No other new lint exemption
was added. Old R1/R2, interrupted WIP, and main-24be refs remain unchanged.

The initial fail-before evidence remains the recorded old-base run; it was not
replayed on main-24be. No independent approval, GitHub protection result, native
iOS build, physical haptic, or live captured-output proof is claimed.
