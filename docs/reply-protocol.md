# Reply identity and arbitration metadata

Status: accepted for protocol v1, issue #14.

Hailing Station associates reply text and audio by explicit identity, never by arrival order. Every new host
reply carries a `reply` descriptor in each text and audio payload:

- `id` is the durable reply identity.
- `host` and `target` are provenance and must equal the frame envelope's `source` and `target`.
- `audioStream` identifies the reply's audio stream. It is absent for text-only replies.
- `priority` is `background`, `normal`, or `urgent`.
- `interruption` is sender intent: `enqueue`, `duck`, or `interrupt`. The mobile terminal remains the final
  arbiter across connected hosts.

Audio payloads repeat the stream as `streamId`, retain their zero-based `sequence`, and carry `final` on the
last segment. A reply-associated audio frame is invalid unless its `streamId` matches the descriptor's
`audioStream`. This makes gaps, completion, and cross-reply contamination detectable before playback.

This is a compatible v1 extension. The existing payload shapes remain valid: new decoders accept legacy text
and audio without a descriptor, and older decoders ignore the new keys. A terminal may display or play a
legacy payload, but it must not associate separate legacy text and audio frames based on timing or adjacency.
New host reply producers must supply the descriptor. Unknown enum values fail closed until a later protocol
version defines their semantics.

Frame `id` remains the identity of one transmitted frame; it is deliberately not reused as reply or stream
identity. Multiple segments from one reply therefore keep unique frame IDs while sharing reply and stream IDs.
